        <h2>Test objects and questions</h2>
        <p>We have been able to reach multiple, and more then expected, people to test our new website. The variance of age has been large, which
        have given us a more broad specter of opinions from different people. Belove are the main six questions we started each interview with, aswell as an intro we have shared belove. </p>
        <p>"Imagine you are a student who wants to rent an apartment. A friend sends you this link. Try to find out more and get in contact with studentmegleren.
          Think your loud. Remember we are testing the page, not you and any input is valuable to us</p>

        <h2>Summeriz of feedback</h2>
        <p>Overall did the our test go very well. All of those who tested the website had positive feedback in general.
          They all liked the design. A feedback we saw repeat it self was that the colours was very calming and plessent to look at.
          The navigation was also successful. We did get compliments for skipping unnecesarily element that usually makes a website messy and hard to deal with.
          Our content was simple and useful in many ways. We did also get a constructive feedback aswell. One of the testers wanted to see more detailes about where the apartments was located aswell as what sort of buildings the company has.
          Overall did we get comments of a very useful and good looking website that was easy to use, as an final conclution.
        </p>
        <p>We are very happy for the feedback in general. Most of it were very positive and cheering. We got a comment about more information of the apartments. This is something that will come in a longer run.
          Before that's posible the company need actual apartments to give information about. We have  alist over elements and sites we would like to add in the future. One of these are the "Tilgjengelige leiligheter" in this section we will add information about the apartments. What we will talk more about after the test
          is if we should make a map aswell. The map should contain locations of housing opportunities

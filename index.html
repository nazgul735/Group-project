        <p>Our customer is "Studentmegleren". At the moment the mentioned company is an idea under development. The concept of this upcoming company is a real-estate broker aimed at students at a national level. This idea is made of Francin A. Vincent and Kevin Alfred, which also will be the main shareholders of the future company. Group 15 is assigned to create the fundamentals as well as a complete suggestion for a functional website that will function in a proper order for both the company and their target of customers. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Purpose_and_goals" id="Purpose">
        <p>With intentions to satisfy the client our group decided to make a website that wakes customer trust as well as functional efficiency, security and positive experiences. To create trust there´s important to have a proper website with logical functions and clean design. The client wishes to announce in a proper manner they are serious brokers with a goal to make the hunt for housing as beneficial as possible for students in general. The website should make it easy to get in contact with the client as well as a menu that shows the offers the company is bringing. Last there have been cleared out that simplicity of the direction from the index to the lease agreement is essential.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Audience" id="audience">
        <p>The target group of this website will be students seeking housing during the period of study. This website will appeal to a specific group, but at the same time a very large group with a broad field of different individuals. Therefore is the safest choice of colours, as we have mentioned, a faded one. The design will also be pretty to look at and simple, with light tones as an overall through thread.</p>

      <div class="content" id="content">
        <h3><b>Draft of content and organized functions:</b></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A big picture with logo and name, on the middle of the screen, two buttons: “Utleier” “Leietaker”</li>
          <li>In the right upper corner, two buttons: “Ledige boliger” “Kontakt”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Based on what you press on the homepage: Utleier</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a page for the people who want to rent out an apartment or several apartments. We will give an overview of why they as a customer should choose us.
            It will also be a small contact form, så that the customer can take contact with us. After this it will be a section with : “Slik fungerer det”, (this will give a description of
            what the customer should do if he/she wants to rent out an apartment) og “Se priser” (this will give the user an insight of our prices). After “Slik fungerer det”,
            it should be a button that says “Kom i gang”.  On the bottom of the page it will be a section with information on what our services are: Utleie, Forvaltning,
            Samarbeid med vaktmester og håndverkere. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Based on what you press on the homepage: Leietaker</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>This page is for the person who wants to rent an apartment or house. There will be a list of why the person should use us. Same as the other page.
            And then there will be three widgets with a button to prompt an action. “Finn din bolig” - this will take you to Finn page with the apartments we have,
            but since the company isn`t operational it will be just show houses available for rental in Trondheim. The second widget is “Bli leietaker” -
            this will take the customer to a page with a contact form. (This is optional) Last widget “Slipp depositum, velg leiegaranti”: It will be an info page about deposit
            and rental warranty. The reason this page is not set in stone, is because it should have a calculator that will find the price for the deposit or the warranty. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>"Om oss"</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is an about page. Info about studentmegleren. Who they are, what they want to do. There will also be two subpages (one for “Våre tjenester” and “Personvernerklæring”.)</li>
          <li>Våre tjenester: is a new info page with what we do, and some info about the warranties we have. There should be way to prompt the customer to take contact with us.</li>
          <li>Personvernerklæring: Privacy Statement, something every website needs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>"Kontakt oss"</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact page, with a form.</li>
          <li>There will be contact information.</li>
          <li>We will also link a button to “Kom igang”.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="functionality" id="functionality">
        <h3><b>Functional and Non-Functional Requirements:</b></h3>
        <p>Our idea so far is to make a website synchronized as much as possible to the ideas we have with the client of the design. As functional requirements is it decided, just a few points so far. The website will have a menu in the center of the header (top of the website) with few, but content-filling choices. This will be used by all customers to direct themself to different choices of apartments/studios and to get in contact with the broker. The bottom will, like most sites, contain the footer with links to contact-information and more, but not surely decided, content.
          For the non- functional requirement is a few points set. The index, or main page, will mainly contain images and videos. What this will look like in specific isn´t decided quite yet, but we are excited to experiment to find an equilibrium of balance in this area. The main colour is decided to be an orange looking, but faded in some manner as mentioned. The colour we have been given as the main colour is #ffe0cc, which is the code for an orange like colour. The font we will use isn´t decided, but we have decided to have a larger font-size for more essential information. Another, but not surely decided, idea we have is to make headlines bolder, that means all sizes of headers.

        <h3><b>Final locations:</b></h3>
        <p>The final location and domain for student megleren will be in charge of maintenance and the domain fees. The website will be published on <a href="www.studentmegleren.no" target="_blank">www.studentmegleren.no</a> when it is done. </p>

        <h1>Studentmegleren</h1>
        <p>Our customer is "Studentmegleren" w/ Francin Vincent. This is a company that is under development. This means that the company is not operational to this day. In this context, the
          "Studentmegleren" wants a website that they can use when the company is started. The "Studentmegleren" will engage in rental brokerage and housing management. </p>

      <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
      <p>This website will first and foremost help the company with its presence on the internet. It is also to increase trust in the customer, nowadays it is difficult to create trust in a supplier who does not have a website. The goal of the website is to bring in customers. It should give the consumer a picture of who the "student broker" is, and at the same time sell the service in a good way. It is desired to create trust in students who want, hence the name. At the same time, the student broker will also be competitive in terms of price and quality. It should be a simple page, the user should not read much for him / her to understand what he / she should do.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Audience">
        The target group of this website will be people who are looking to find someone who can manage their housing, there may be landlords who do all the work themselves and finally people who are looking for housing (mainly students). This website should appeal to more people, and it is a broad target group. Everything from students to older people. Thus, it will be important to have colors that are not too strong, so that it will be comfortable for the user to be on the website. Design must not be too complicated either.<div>
      <div class="content">
        <p style="font-size:1.05em "><b>Homepage</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>A big picture with logo and name, on the middle of the screen, two buttons: “Utleier” “Leietaker”</li>
          <li>In the right upper corner, two buttons: “Ledige boliger” “Kontakt”</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:1.05em "><b>Based on what you press on the homepage: Utleier</b><p>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a page for the people who want to rent out an apartment or several apartments. We will give an overview of why they as a customer should choose us.
            It will also be a small contact form, så that the customer can take contact with us. After this it will be a section with : “Slik fungerer det”, (this will give a description of
            what the customer should do if he/she wants to rent out an apartment) og “Se priser” (this will give the user an insight of our prices). After “Slik fungerer det”,
            it should be a button that says “Kom i gang”.  On the bottom of the page it will be a section with information on what our services are: Utleie, Forvaltning,
            Samarbeid med vaktmester og håndverkere. </li>

            And then there will be three widgets with a button to prompt an action. “Finn din bolig” - this will take you to Finn page with the apartments we have,
            but since the company isn`t operational it will be just show houses available for rental in Trondheim. The second widget is “Bli leietaker” -
            this will take the customer to a page with a contact form. (This is optional) Last widget “Slipp depositum, velg leiegaranti”: It will be an info page about deposit
            and rental warranty. The reason this page is not set in stone, is because it should have a calculator that will find the price for the deposit or the warranty. </li>
